# Macro2OptionTrigger
simple script that converts xdbot macros to option triggers with enable/disable p1 controls 



# How to use

the most simple way to use this script is using the ObjectStringPasting mod by Tendart for geode, this mod is currently available only for geometry dash 2.204 so yeah rip gd 2.206, you can install the mod in the releases tab


# -----

i wanna improve this script by removing the extra inputs made by xdbot bc it records every frame when u hold click so yeah xd
